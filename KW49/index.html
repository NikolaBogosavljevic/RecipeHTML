    <p>Pour in the sugar in to a bowl and cut up the butter so it is easier to mix.<br>
    Mix it up until it is homogenes.</p>

    <p>When you're done with mixing it up, put in the 2 eggs<br>
    and keep on mixing.</p>
    <div><img src="picture/IMG_3195.jpg" alt="add chocolate powder"></div>
    <p>After that is all mixed up and it is nice and creamy, you can take the chocolate powder<br>
    and put it all in. Now mix it again.</p>
    <div><img src="picture/IMG_3198.jpg" alt="add flour"></div>
    <p>Nowm that you mixed that up you can add the flour.<br>

    <p>When have mixed up a little bit of the flour, you can put all of it in<br>
    Now you should start mixing with your hands.</p>
    <div><img src="picture/IMG_3203.jpg" alt="Mix with hands"></div>
    <p>Now you should cover a flat surface with flour. <br>
    Take the mixture out and start kneading until it is ready. <br>
    Then you should wrap it up and leave it in your fridge for 20 mins.</p>
    <div><img src="picture/IMG_3209.jpg" alt="Cut out shapes"></div>
    <p>After the 20 mins you should roll out the dough and it should be evenly thick. <br>
    Then you can cut out the different shapes you want. <br>
    When you run out of space just out the rest together and roll it out again. <br>
    Do that until you cant anymore.</p>
    <div><img src="picture/IMG_3211.jpg" alt="Oven"></div>
    <p>Lay out the shapes and put them in the oven. <br>
